**Q1.In what situation would you consider mean over median?**
### **Prefer Mean**  
- When the data is **symmetric** or **normally distributed**.  
- When there are **no outliers**.  
- When all data points are equally important.  

### **Prefer Median**  
- When the data has **outliers** or is **skewed**.  
- When working with **ordinal data** or ranks.  
- When you need a **robust** measure unaffected by extremes.
IN short when outlier present try selecting median because when outliers are not present select mean.

**Q2.What is margin of error.For sample size n, the margin of error is 3. How many more samples do we need to make the margin of error 0.3?**

The margin of error indicates the potential range within which the true value lies. For example, if a poll shows that 60% of people like a product with a margin of error of Â±3%, 
the true percentage could be between 57% and 63%.
margin of error **inversly propotional to sqaureroot(samplesize)**
**Q3.What is the assumption of error in linear regression? **
