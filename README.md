****1.Prompt Engineering & Basics of LLM****
a. What is the difference between Predictive/Discriminative AI and Generative AI? 
Predictive AI Example:
You show a machine a photo of an animal and ask, "Is this a dog or a cat?"
It predicts the answer: "This is a dog."
Generative AI Example:
You tell the machine, "Make a picture of a dog."
It creates a new picture of a dog that didnâ€™t exist before, based on what it learned about dogs.
Think of Predictive AI as recognizing something, and Generative AI as creating something.
b.What is an LLM?
LLM stands for Large Language Model. It's a type of artificial intelligence that can understand and generate human-like text. LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data, enabling them to answer questions, summarize information, translate languages, and more.
For example, tools like ChatGPT are LLMs. You ask it questions, and it responds in a way that mimics human communication.
How are LLMs Trained?
Training an LLM involves three main steps:
1. Collecting Data
LLMs are trained on a huge variety of text data, such as books, articles, websites, and more.
Example: Imagine teaching a student by giving them access to all the books in a library to read.
2. Learning Patterns
The model learns patterns in the text by predicting the next word in a sentence based on the previous words.
Example: If the sentence is, "The sun rises in the ___," the model learns to predict "east."
It uses millions or billions of examples to refine its understanding.
3. Fine-tuning
After the initial training, the model can be further fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains (e.g., medical advice, legal language). This makes it more accurate for specific purposes.
Example: After general training, you might give the model medical textbooks to specialize in medical conversations.
Simplified Example:
Imagine teaching a child to write essays:
First, the child reads thousands of books to understand grammar, vocabulary, and style.
Then, the child practices writing by filling in blanks or completing sentences.
Finally, you give them feedback or examples in specific topics (e.g., science) to improve their writing on that topic.
LLMs work similarly, but instead of a child, they use powerful computers to process and learn from vast amounts of text!
