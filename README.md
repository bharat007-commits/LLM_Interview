a. What is the difference between Predictive/Discriminative AI and Generative AI? 
Predictive AI Example:
You show a machine a photo of an animal and ask, "Is this a dog or a cat?"
It predicts the answer: "This is a dog."
Generative AI Example:
You tell the machine, "Make a picture of a dog."
It creates a new picture of a dog that didnâ€™t exist before, based on what it learned about dogs.
Think of Predictive AI as recognizing something, and Generative AI as creating something.
